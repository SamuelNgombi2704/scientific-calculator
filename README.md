# My Project

Welcome! This is a web application I've built using modern frontend tools and design systems. The project is structured for scalability, fast development, and clean UI, making it suitable for both personal and production use.

## 🚀 What I Built

This project is a React-based web application built with:

* **Vite** – for lightning-fast development and bundling
* **TypeScript** – for safer, more maintainable code
* **Tailwind CSS** – for utility-first styling
* **shadcn/ui** – for elegant, accessible UI components built on Radix UI

The app is fully responsive, performant, and easy to extend.

## 🛠 How I Work With the Code

To work on this project locally, I use the following setup:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Move into the project directory
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, I can preview the app at `http://localhost:5173` (or whichever port Vite uses).

## 🌐 Deployment

For deployment, I typically use platforms like **Vercel** or **Netlify** which support seamless integration with GitHub. These platforms handle continuous deployment automatically on every push to the main branch.

## 🌍 Custom Domain

To connect a custom domain:

1. I go to my hosting platform’s dashboard (e.g., Vercel or Netlify).
2. I navigate to the domain settings.
3. I add my custom domain and update DNS settings as needed.

## 🤝 Contributions and Collaboration

While this is currently a personal project, I’ve set it up in a way that makes it easy to scale or collaborate in the future. Feel free to fork it or reach out if you'd like to build on top of it.

## 💡 Future Plans

I'm planning to:

* Add backend integration via an API (e.g., FastAPI or Firebase)
* Improve accessibility and testing
* Deploy a production version with performance optimizations
